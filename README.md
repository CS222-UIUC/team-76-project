# Mr. Game & Rate

## Project Overview
Mr. Game and Rate is a social platform where gamers can rate, review, and discuss video games. It brings different opinions within the gaming community into one place, making it easier to discover games and share insights.  
Unlike platforms like Metacritic or IGN, Mr. Game & Rate focuses on community-driven discussion, not just scores from critics. We created this project to build a space where gamers can connect through meaningful reviews, instead of star ratings.
